These are the project I did in Web Applicayions (CSE 183) @ UCSC taught by Luca de Alfaro. 

Technolgies: py4web which uses javascript, Bulma CSS, and python.
bottle.py is the db

Note: The use of signing/encrypting requests is used throughtout this course to ensure our applications are safe to some degree. 

1) Bulma CSS project is a simple one page app that was designed for students
to get there feet wet with web technologies used for this class. 

2) Product Listing. Allow user to sort list items by various attributes. Ex: sort by ascending to descending price range

4) Postlandia is a simple posting forum that allows users to create/edit/delete their posts on a forum. User priviledges are limited
if the post does not belong to the current user and required different styling than the Address Book.

5) Post-O-Matic was an advanced project that built off Postlandia which allows more actions depending on user context. Example: users
can reply to other users posts. This required more styling of course so that it was apparent to users that posts and comments differ.

6) Thumbrater is essentially a build off of Product Listing that allows users to rate different products.
